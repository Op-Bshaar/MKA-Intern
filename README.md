#### ðŸ›  Steps to Run Sales Forecast Project

1. **Clone the repository:**

git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <repo-root>

2. **Setup backend (FastAPI):**

cd backend_sales
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate       # Windows
# or source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app:app --reload

3. Setup frontend (Next.js): 
cd frontend_sales/frontend
npm install
npm run dev
